In this step, you'll execute SQL to create resource monitors for controlling compute spending. This step produces:

1. **Resource Monitor** (`resource_monitor_name`) — A monitor with your specified credit quota and monitoring period
2. **Threshold Actions** — Notifications at 75% and 90%, with configurable action (notify or suspend) at 100%

Resource monitors provide hard spending limits—unlike budgets (which only alert), monitors can actually suspend warehouses when limits are exceeded.

The monitor is configured with:
- **Credit Quota**: Maximum credits allowed per period (`resource_monitor_limit`)
- **Monitoring Frequency**: How often usage is checked (typically MONTHLY)
- **Threshold Actions**: What happens at each percentage threshold

Resource monitors created here are used in subsequent steps:
- **Assign Monitors to Warehouses**: Associates monitor with data product warehouses
- **Configure Alert Notifications**: Adds notification recipients

**Account Context:** Execute this SQL from the target account with ACCOUNTADMIN role.

## **Why is this important?**

Resource monitors prevent unexpected costs:
- **Hard Limits**: Stop spending when budget is exhausted
- **Early Warnings**: Alerts before reaching limits
- **Predictable Costs**: Stay within allocated budgets

Think of resource monitors as a prepaid phone plan — you set your monthly limit, get warnings as you approach it, and service stops when it's exhausted.

## **Prerequisites**

- Target account accessible with ACCOUNTADMIN role
- Warehouse definitions from the Plan Warehouse Requirements step
- Understanding of expected credit consumption

## **Key Concepts**

**Credit Quotas**
Set the maximum credits allowed per period:
- Based on expected workload
- Consider buffer for spikes

**Monitoring Frequency**
How often Snowflake checks credit usage:
- Default is every 15-30 minutes
- More frequent for smaller quotas

**Reset Frequency**
When the credit counter resets:
- **Monthly**: Most common for budgeting
- **Weekly**: For tighter control
- **Never**: One-time allocation

**Threshold Best Practices**
Use tiered thresholds for graduated response:
- 75%: Warning (notify)
- 90%: Alert (notify)
- 100%: Action (suspend or notify)

**Note:** Snowflake allows only ONE suspend trigger per resource monitor, so the 100% threshold is your enforcement point.

### Configuration Questions

#### What is the name of this data product? (`data_product_name`: text)
**What is this asking?**
Provide a descriptive name for your data product. This name will be used in database names, role names, and resource tags.

**Why does this matter?**
The data product name is a key component of object naming:
- Databases: `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<zone>_<env>` (based on your naming convention)
- Roles: `<dataproduct>_owner`, `<dataproduct>_reader`
- Tags: `DATAPRODUCT = '<dataproduct>'`

A clear, descriptive name makes resources easy to identify and manage.

**Naming Guidelines:**
- Use lowercase, single words or concatenated words (no underscores)
- Underscores are reserved for separating naming components (domain, zone, env)
- Be descriptive but concise
- Reflect the business purpose or use case
- Avoid technical jargon unless widely understood
- Avoid reserved words or special characters

**Examples:**
| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `customer360` | Unified customer data and analytics |
| `salesanalytics` | Sales reporting and analysis |
| `supplychain` | Supply chain operations data |
| `finreporting` | Financial reporting and compliance |
| `marketing` | Marketing campaign attribution |
| `productcatalog` | Product information management |
| `inventory` | Inventory tracking and forecasting |

**Recommendation:**
Choose a name that business users would recognize. Ask: "If someone searched for this data, what would they type?"

**More Information:**
* [Identifier Requirements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax) — Valid characters and length limits

#### Which domain does this data product belong to? (`data_product_domain`: multi-select)
**What is this asking?**
Select the business domain (team, department, or organizational unit) that owns this data product.

**Auto-Detection for Multi-Account Strategies:**
- **Domain-based accounts**: Your domain is determined by your target account. Select the matching value.
- **Domain + Environment accounts**: Your domain is derived from the first part of your account name. Select the matching value.
- **Environment-based accounts**: Domain is not determined by your account. Select from the available options.
- **Single Account**: Domain is not determined by your account. Select from the available options.

**Why does this matter?**
Domain assignment determines:
- **Cost Allocation**: Credits consumed are attributed to this domain
- **Ownership**: The domain team is responsible for the data product
- **Access Patterns**: Domain-based roles may have different access levels
- **Governance**: Domain-specific policies may apply

**How domains are used:**
- Object names may include the domain abbreviation
- The `DOMAIN` tag is applied to all resources
- Cost reports can filter by domain

**Available Domains:**
Your organization defined these domains in Platform Foundation. If you need a new domain, update Platform Foundation first.

**If your domain isn't listed:**
Work with your platform team to add the domain to Platform Foundation, then return to this workflow.

**Recommendation:**
For domain-based and domain+environment strategies, select the domain that matches your target account name.

#### Which environment is this data product being deployed to? (`data_product_environment`: multi-select)
**What is this asking?**
Select the SDLC environment for this data product deployment.

**Auto-Detection for Multi-Account Strategies:**
- **Environment-based accounts**: Your environment is determined by your target account. Select the matching value.
- **Domain + Environment accounts**: Your environment is derived from the second part of your account name. Select the matching value.
- **Domain-based accounts**: Environment is not determined by your account. Select from the available options.
- **Single Account**: Environment is not determined by your account. Select from the available options.

**Why does this matter?**
Environment assignment determines:
- **Isolation**: Resources are created in the appropriate context
- **Access Controls**: Production typically has stricter access
- **Resource Sizing**: Dev environments may use smaller warehouses
- **Data Sensitivity**: Production may have real data vs. synthetic in dev

**Common Environments:**
| Abbreviation | Full Name | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| `dev` | Development | Building and testing code |
| `test` | Testing/QA | Quality assurance |
| `stg` | Staging | Pre-production validation |
| `prod` | Production | Live environment |

**Recommendation:**
For environment-based and domain+environment strategies, select the environment that matches your target account name.

#### How many credits should be the monthly limit for this data product? (`resource_monitor_limit`: text)
Enter the maximum monthly credit consumption allowed for this data product's warehouses.

Examples:
- `100` — Small data product, limited queries
- `500` — Medium workload
- `1000` — Heavy ETL and analytics
- `5000` — Large-scale data product

**How to estimate:**
- X-Small warehouse = ~1 credit/hour
- Small warehouse = ~2 credits/hour
- Medium warehouse = ~4 credits/hour
- Estimate hours of use × warehouse size × days

**Why does this matter?**
Setting appropriate limits prevents:
- Bill shock from runaway queries
- Budget overruns
- Unexpected cloud costs

Start conservative — you can always increase the limit.

#### What should happen when the credit limit is reached? (`resource_monitor_action`: multi-select)
Choose the action when 100% of credits are consumed:

- **Notify Only**: Warehouses continue running. Use for non-critical data products or when you'll manually intervene.
- **Suspend**: Warehouses stop after current queries complete. Recommended for most data products.
- **Suspend Immediately**: Kills in-flight queries and stops warehouses. Use for strict budget enforcement.

**Why does this matter?**
- Too aggressive → Queries fail unexpectedly
- Too permissive → Costs exceed budget

**Recommendation:** Start with "Suspend" for production, "Notify Only" for development.
**Options:**
- Notify Only (continue running)
- Suspend (stop warehouse gracefully)
- Suspend Immediately (kill queries and stop)

#### What account strategy do you wish to implement? (`account_strategy`: multi-select)
Choose the account strategy that best fits your organization. Your choice determines how domain (business unit/entity) and environment are organized:  
  **Single Account:**  
  * Best for: Small to medium organizations, centralized teams, simpler governance  
  * Naming: Domain \+ Environment \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Lower operational overhead, easier cross-database queries, centralized management  
  * Cons: Less isolation, shared resource limits, single security boundary  
  * Recommendation: Consider setting up an organization account even for single-account deployments to enable future growth  
* **Multi-Account (Environment-based):**  
  * Best for: Organizations requiring strong environment isolation (dev/test/prod)  
  * Naming: Environment at account level, Domain \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Complete environment isolation, independent security controls, separate billing  
  * Cons: More complex data sharing, higher operational overhead  
  * Requirement: Organization account required  
* **Multi-Account (Domain-based):**  
  * Best for: Large enterprises with autonomous business units/domains  
  * Naming: Domain at account level, Environment \+ Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Clear cost allocation per domain, independent governance, domain autonomy  
  * Cons: Higher complexity, requires data sharing for cross-domain analytics  
  * Requirement: Organization account required  
* **Multi-Account (Domain \+ Environment):**  
  * Best for: Large organizations needing both domain and environment isolation  
  * Naming: Domain \+ Environment at account level, Data Product at database level  
  * Pros: Maximum isolation, clear ownership and environment separation  
  * Cons: Highest complexity and operational overhead, most accounts to manage  
  * Requirement: Organization account required  
* **More Information:**  
  * [Organizations](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations)  
  * [Managing Multiple Accounts](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/organizations-manage-accounts)  
**Options:**
- Single Account
- Multi-Account (Environment-based)
- Multi-Account (Domain-based)
- Multi-Account (Domain + Environment)

#### Which account will this data product be deployed to? (`target_account_name`: text)

**What is this asking?**
Enter the name of the Snowflake account where this data product will be created.

**Why does this matter?**
This ensures all generated SQL is clearly documented with the target account, preventing deployment errors and providing clear audit trails.

**How to find your account name:**
- In Snowsight: Click your account name in the bottom-left corner
- Run SQL: `SELECT CURRENT_ACCOUNT_NAME();`
- From your URL: `https://<org>-<account>.snowflakecomputing.com`

**Examples based on strategy:**

**Domain-based strategy:**
- `ACME_SALES` - Sales domain account
- `ACME_FINANCE` - Finance domain account

**Environment-based strategy:**
- `ACME_DEV` - Development environment account
- `ACME_PROD` - Production environment account

**Domain + Environment strategy:**
- `ACME_SALES_DEV` - Sales domain, Development environment
- `ACME_FINANCE_PROD` - Finance domain, Production environment

**Recommendation:**
Copy the exact account name from your Snowflake session to avoid typos.

#### What core component ordering will be used for account-level object names? (`object_component_order`: multi-select)
**Why Order Matters:**  
Snowflake displays objects alphabetically. The component order determines how objects cluster together in Snowsight, BI tools, and queries.  

**Option 1: `<domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>`**  
* Objects cluster by **domain first**, then by environment  
* All Finance objects together, all Marketing objects together  
* Example: `FIN_PROD_ANALYTICS`, `FIN_DEV_ANALYTICS`, `MKT_PROD_CAMPAIGNS`  
* Best for: Organizations where domain ownership is primary  

**Option 2: `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>`**  
* Objects cluster by **domain first**, then by data product  
* All Finance Analytics together across environments  
* Example: `FIN_ANALYTICS_PROD`, `FIN_ANALYTICS_DEV`, `MKT_CAMPAIGNS_PROD`  
* Best for: Data product-centric organizations  

**Option 3: `<env>_<domain>_<dataproduct>`**  
* Objects cluster by **environment first**  
* All Production objects together, all Development objects together  
* Example: `PROD_FIN_ANALYTICS`, `PROD_MKT_CAMPAIGNS`, `DEV_FIN_ANALYTICS`  
* Best for: Operations teams focused on environment-based management  

**Recommendation:** Most organizations prefer `<domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>` or `<domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>` for domain-centric clustering.  

**More Information:**  
* [Object Identifiers](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers)  
**Options:**
- <domain>_<env>_<dataproduct>
- <domain>_<dataproduct>_<env>
- <env>_<domain>_<dataproduct>
